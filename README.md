# Welcome to Expo on Replit ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app), and adapted to use on Replit.

## Get started

**Click the Run button to start the app.**

In the output, use the QR code to open the app in [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), or open a webview.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
